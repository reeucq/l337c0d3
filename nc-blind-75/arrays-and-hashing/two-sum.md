# Question
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return _indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`_.
You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

[1. Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

## Approaches
1. **Brute Force**: This can be done using nested loops, where the outer loop iterates from the first element to the second-to-last element, and the inner loop iterates from the next element to the last element. However, this approach has a time complexity of $O(n^2)$. Space complexity is $O(1)$.
2. A more efficient approach is to use a hash table (unordered_map in C++). We can iterate through the array once, and for each element, check if the target minus the current element exists in the hash table. If it does, we have found a valid pair of numbers. If not, we add the current element to the hash table. Time complexity of this approach is $O(n)$ and Space complexity is $O(n)$.

## Solutions
### Java Approach 1
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        int n = nums.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {
                    return new int[]{i, j};
                }
            }
        }
        return new int[]{}; // No solution found
    }
}
```

### Java Approach 2
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> numMap = new HashMap<>();
        int n = nums.length;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            if (numMap.containsKey(complement)) {
                return new int[]{numMap.get(complement), i};
            }
            numMap.put(nums[i], i);
        }

        return new int[]{}; // No solution found
    }
}
```
